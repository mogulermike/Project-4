# Project-4: PLANT APP

## Description:
Once you get labeled as "that plant person" you will constantly have people asking you about plants. What are good beginner plants? Why is my plant dying? And my personal favorite especially with the holidays coming up, "What plants do you not have that you want?"

With this plant app, you can learn about plants, and most importantly have a wishlist of your plants with high quality pictures that you can send to people wanting to buy you a gift!

## Stretch Goals
Incorporate a page where it shows top liked plants. This would be another table in the backend database that each user can contribute to. 

Plant mini game: water plants? trivia? clear pests?

(Push for this) Send email with wishlist information



## User Stories

"My family keeps asking me what plants they can get me... this app made it super easy to share a list with great pictures!"

"I've always wanted to learn more information about the plants I own and this makes it super easy because i can set up my list and then click on those plants"

## Technologies Used
React, Express, PSQL, Google, Instructors, Trefle.io, join tables

## Issues 
Unsolved Problems: I got the API to work, but it had a lot more information than I needed. I could try to find another repo with more basic houseplant information, or just focus on building my own database better. 

More plants in the database. Option to delete plants.
