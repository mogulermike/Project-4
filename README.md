# Project-4: PLANT APP

## Description:
Once you get labeled as "that plant person" you will constantly have people asking you about plants. What are good beginner plants? Why is my plant dying? And my personal favorite especially with the holidays coming up, "What plants do you not have that you want?"

With this plant app, you can learn about plants, and most importantly have a wishlist of your plants with high quality pictures that you can send to people wanting to buy you a gift!
